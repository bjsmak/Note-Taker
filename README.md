## Note-Taker

## Summary

The purpose of this project is using express to demonstrate the use of server-side javascript and how it communicates with the front-end. Given a specific set of HTML, the user is to be able to enter notes and delete them using the website. However, the functionality is controlled by the server itself. By using POST, GET, and DELETE methods, the website is able to manipulate JSON data that is brought in by the user. Other dependencies included the use of path & uuid to allow the ease of deleting specific notes.

If notes are entered and the user would like to delete, the trash can icon can be clicked to remove the note. This is done using the delete method.<br>
